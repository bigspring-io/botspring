## ðŸ›  Development

1. Make sure you've followed the [BigSpring monorepo setup](https://github.com/bigspring-io/bigspring/blob/development/docs/getting-started.md#-setting-up-the-repository) instructions to install Node.js and build the [`bigspring/node:1.1.0`](https://github.com/bigspring-io/bigspring/blob/development/docker/Dockerfile) Docker image.
2. [Download and setup ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
3. Install npm dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Rename [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and fill in the tokens as needed from [1Password](https://bigspringskills.1password.com), [Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps/A022MG521QV), or other necessary APIs.
5. Start Docker containers with hot reloading:

   ```bash
   yarn start -d
   ```
